                 resource that will guide students throughout their undergraduate career. We understand that each student is unique, 
                 and through our platform, we offer a variety of resources to help them navigate career options effectively.
                  Whether it's finding the right job or internship, preparing for interviews, or exploring BMCC community resources,
                   our platform provides convenient accessibility to comprehensive information in a structured manner.<br><br>In the future, our primary focus is on enhancing our chatbot, making it a true personal mentor for each student. We envision a chatbot capable of providing personalized recommendations and tailored suggestions based on individual skills and aspirations. But that's not all; we aim to enrich the student experience further. We're dedicated to expanding the resources available on our website, empowering students on their career readiness journey
